It happens in two parts: 
1. The easy part  & the most difficult to find :: Git (BitBucket) is used for updating the codes on the repo for 
                                                    any customization needed.

2. The difficult part & the most easy one to find :: Changes that are supposed to be done manually on the CMS (on the dev
                                                    environment & on prod environment) have to be replicated once coding 
                                                    has been done.
